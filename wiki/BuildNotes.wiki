=Hints/ Tricks/ Suggestions on building the squeakvm for android=

*make sure that you copy the correct libsqueakvm.so* <br/>
_android_ndk_xyz/apps/squeakvm/project/libs/armeabi/libsqueakvm.sq_ to
the right location in your eclipse-workspace _workspace/SqueakVM/lbs/armeabi/_. 
The size of that .so should be about 370 kb. During compilation there will be produced a libsqueakvm.so into a different folder ("out") - that file is much bigger and it won't work!

*refresh the eclipse-workspace after copying libsqueakvm.so* <br/>
If you want to make sure that eclipse recognizes the new version of the shared library, clean the project.

*I had serious problems with version release 3 of the ndk* <br/>
I encountered SIGSEGVs in various JNI-calls. With the NDK release 1 everything works fine.
